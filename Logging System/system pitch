"I’ve designed a highly scalable and resilient centralized logging and monitoring system.

Logs from clients and application servers are collected through lightweight log forwarders like Fluent Bit or CloudWatch agents. These logs are sent into a processing layer that runs on EC2/ECS with Auto Scaling Groups and Kubernetes HPA for elasticity. To handle traffic spikes, I’ve integrated Kafka/Kinesis as a buffer, ensuring no logs are lost during peak loads.

From there, processed logs are routed to Elasticsearch for search, CloudWatch/Grafana for visualization, and Prometheus + SNS for real-time alerting. For compliance and cost efficiency, long-term retention is done in S3/Glacier with KMS encryption.

This design ensures:

Scalability through ASG + HPA

Reliability with Kafka/Kinesis buffering

Security with KMS encryption

Observability via dashboards and alerts

In short, this system guarantees that even at millions of log events per second, we achieve real-time visibility, cost-effective storage, and proactive incident response."_
